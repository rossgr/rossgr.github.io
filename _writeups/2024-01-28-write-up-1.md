Firstly, connect to the TryHackMe network using OpenVPN or the built in AttackBox option on the site. Once connected we can set up some directories for storing logs and other files we encounter during the test!

We are going to use nmap (network mapper) tool to get an understanding of what services are running on the target, what OS they may be using and any other potential outdated software that could be used to gain further information about the target.

```bash
sudo nmap -sS -sC -O $ip -oN nmap/initial
```

From the nmap results we can see 6 open ports running services on the server. These are 22, 80, 139, 445, 8009, 8080. We can also see the server is running Linux 5.X so some kind of Linux distribution.

Viewing the web page returns a maintenance page that the site is currently being worked on. In the source code we see mentions of a dev section for workers to see what tasks they need to complete. This could expose some vulnerabilities so it would be good for us to find.

Next Iâ€™m going to run nikto to find any misconfigurations in the setup of the server.

After running nikto we can see these results.

```bash
nikto -h $ip
```

We have identified the directory /development which we indicated earlier could be of interest to us as well as the version of Apache being outdated. This is the name of the hidden folder for question 3!

Weâ€™re also going to use gobuster to try and find anymore hidden subfolders and see if they have anything promising to offer us.

After running gobuster we can only see /development as a useful folder for us to use so letâ€™s use it!

So letâ€™s take a look at the development page.

On the site we can see two text files which we can access.

Dev.txt

```
2018-04-23: I've been messing with that struts stuff, and it's pretty cool! I think it might be neat
to host that on this server too. Haven't made any real web apps yet, but I have tried that example
you get to show off how it works (and it's the REST version of the example!). Oh, and right now I'm
using version 2.5.12, because other versions were giving me trouble. -K

2018-04-22: SMB has been configured. -K

2018-04-21: I got Apache set up. Will put in our content later. -J

```

J.txt

```
For J:

I've been auditing the contents of /etc/shadow to make sure we don't have any weak credentials,
and I was able to crack your hash really easily. You know our password policy, so please follow
it? Change that password ASAP.

-K

```

We know from the two text files that users J and K are on the system. We can presume that they are using shorthand for their names and their usernames could be used to help crack the weak password mentioned by K in the text file.

We also know that they are running Samba for SMB. As seen in our nmap scan.

Letâ€™s use enum4linux to try and find out some basic information about the system.

```bash
enum4linux -a $ip
```

After running enum4linux we get a whole bunch of different information about users, shares, password policy information, group and member lists etc.

![Untitled](Basic%20Pentesting%207806f176daa6444ca2d174ee8976a5ae/Untitled%203.png)

Success! We know the usernames of both K and J found in the text files on the development subfolder. Now that we have a username and we know that jan has a particularly weak password as stated in the note from kay, we can use hydra to try and brute-force their password.

```bash
hydra -l jan -P /path-to/rockyou.txt ssh://$ip
```

![Untitled](Basic%20Pentesting%207806f176daa6444ca2d174ee8976a5ae/Untitled%204.png)

Bingo! We have found jans password. That answers another question.

After logging in via ssh we can start to have a snoop around the system.

```bash
sudo -l
```

Shows us that we do not have permission to run commands as sudo.

Navigating around the filesystem we can see another user kay and we can access their home directory.

```bash
cd /home/kay
```

Running ls -la we can see a file called pass.bak, could this be kayâ€™s password? We can attempt to view this password using cat but we do not have permissions to do so in this users directory. Letâ€™s try and find possible privilege escalation vectors using linpeas.

```bash
scp /path-to/linpeas.sh jan@$ip:/dev/
```

Letâ€™s copy linpeas over to the target machine as we have the ssh login.

Now letâ€™s mark this file as executable using the chmod +x linpeas.sh.

```bash
./linpeas.sh | tee log.txt
```

Weâ€™re piping it into tee to save the output in a text file.

Linpeas returns a lot of interesting things to look at but most notable is an ssh private key.

Letâ€™s try and connect using this private key.

```bash
ssh -i id_rsa@$ip
```

The private key is password protected so we have to use JohnTheRipper to bruteforce the password. Firstly, letâ€™s make use of ssh2john to convert the keyfile into a text format so we can use john to decrypt it.

```bash
ssh2john id_rsa > id_hash
```

Now we can run john to crack the password.

```bash
john --wordlist=rockyou.txt id_hash
```

This returns the correct password for the user kay. So letâ€™s login using her credentials.

And to answer the final question we can simply cat the pass.bak file to get the final password.

```bash
cd /home/kay && cat pass.bak
```
