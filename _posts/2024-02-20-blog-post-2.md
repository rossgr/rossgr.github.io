## What is enum4linux?

Enum4Linux is a tool that allows you to enumerate information from Windows and Samba systems. Samba is an open-source implementation of the **Server Message Block (SMB)** protocol for Unix systems (Robert Sheldon, no date). The Samba platform allows communication between Unix and Windows hosts on a network. This allows Unix hosts to access Windows file and print services and is a vital component in integrating Linux/Unix servers into Active Directory environments (Samba, no date).

Enum4linux is built around the Samba tools suite to enable penetration testers to retrieve information about a target system including its operating system, group membership information, workgroup, or domain membership and even password policy retrieval all using one tool. It attempts to replicate the functionality of enum.exe on Windows machines. (Kali, 2023).

### What will this tutorial cover?

In this tutorial, I will cover the concepts of why using a tool like enum4linux is important in the reconnaissance phase of a penetration test. I will show you how to access enum4linux and install it on Kali (if it has not been pre-installed on your system). I will also use the Basic Pentesting box from TryHackMe to demonstrate the tool and its numerous different settings.
